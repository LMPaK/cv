                <p><em>RN, <strong>MSN</strong></em> </p>
            
                <p>I am a wife and mother of two that has made the decision to change to a different
                    career field. I have a background in pediatric nursing and training in Women's Health Nursing. I enjoy palm trees and warm
                    weather, spending time with my family and two dogs, and baking recipes passed down from my late father and late great aunt.
                    I am most at home <a href="pagephoto4.jpg">by the water</a>, whether it be on a boat fishing, or on the beach relaxing to the sound of waves.
                    When I have a little time to myself, I also enjoy genealogy and discovering how my ancestor's lived and settled in America.
                 </p>
                 <p>After taking some time away from my career to grow our family and become a foster mother, COVID hit. Between the pandemic
                    and a loved one dying, I did some soul-searching and decided to make a career change. I needed
                    a career that was more stable, flexible, and safe for my family. My brother was working as a software
                    developer at the time, and I found myself wanting a lot of what his career offered him.</p> 
                 <p>Throughout college I had taken Web Development and Nursing Informatics courses. While working as a secretary for a construction company, I had
                    even built a website for my employer. Remembering all the times that computers and the internet had been weaved into my
                    personal and professional life, I realized it was still something I was passionate about and quite honestly more comfortable
                    with than nursing. I built that website around the age of 19, and now nearly twenty years later I am ready to get back to
                    where I first began. Back then it seemed like it was such a male-dominated field, so it is encouraging to now see so many women in tech. 
                    I know it will be challenging, but I am driven, self-motivated, and of course, excited!</p>
